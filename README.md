README.captcha

Dead simple plugin-less  library-less framework-less filter for online content.

You have something you want to make available but discourage abuse 
so you use a reCaptcha, which is just generating a form and evaulating the 
respose to determine whether or not to display the content. 
Google offers this as a service and uses the work done to digitise books 
(crowd serfing) which they then sell ads on while stiffing authors 
but that is another story.
