README.captcha

Dead simple plugin-less  library-less framework-less filter for online content.

You have something you want to make available but discourage abuse 
so you use a reCaptcha, which is just generating a form and evaluating the 
response to determine whether or not to display the content. 
Google offers this as a service and uses the work done to digitize books
and street view images.  

To use put the (possibly edited) template files in the web directory 
you are using (probably along side the content page you are protecting)

Put the captcha.cgi where it can be executed by your web server 
probably under cgi-bin. 

Edit captcha.cgi,  at minimum you need to 
	add your Google recaptcha keys for_the_host_the_script_is_served 
	the keys are generated by:
	https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create 
	Add the name of the content to serve when a recaptcha is solved
	and possibly correct paths if you are moving things around. 


The "template" files are just plain HTML with embedded shell variables wrapped in heredoc.


Why?  
Choosing a language to import a library implementing a framework to replace 
barely a half page "if ..then ... else redirect"  just rubs me the wrong way.

Why not?  
I am not a security expert, so I'm interested to hear any theories with proofs 
on how this could be vulnerable.
