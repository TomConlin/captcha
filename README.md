README.captcha

Dead simple plugin-less  library-less framework-less filter for online content.

You have something you want to make available but discourage abuse 
so you use a reCaptcha, which is just generating a form and evaluating the 
response to determine whether or not to display the content. 
Google offers this as a service and uses the work done to digitize books
and street view images.  

To use, put the (possibly edited) template files in some directory 
outside webroot (perhaps along side the content page you are protecting)
The "template" files are just plain HTML with embedded shell variables wrapped in heredoc.
For security reasons these template files should not be web accessible.

Put the captcha.cgi where it can be executed by your web server 
probably under cgi-bin/. 

Edit captcha.cgi,  at minimum you need to 
	add your Google recaptcha keys _for_the_host_the_script_is_served_from_ 
	the keys are generated by:
	https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create 
	Adjust the path for the templates 
	and path and name of the content to serve when a recaptcha is solved. 


Why?  
Choosing a language to import a library implementing a framework to replace 
barely a half page "if ..then ... else redirect"  just rubs me the wrong way.

Why not?  
I am not a security expert, so I'm interested to hear testable theories
on how this could be vulnerable.
